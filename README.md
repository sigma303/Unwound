# Unwound
Unwound - chord progression generator

Unwound is a modern, interactive music helper for generating chord progressions in any key. Designed with musicians, composers, and hobbyists in mind, it helps you quickly explore musical ideas, experiment with scales, and get creative with chords.

Built with C# and WPF, Unwound combines a clean, modern interface with responsive design and dynamic gradients for a professional look and feel.

While it looks nice, its still in its early days, i plan on making pictures of what those chords would actually look like when played on a real intrument (thats what those instruments on the left side are supoosed to be).

I still have to get a lot of things done, like adding chord extentions and inversions, saving/loading progressions...

This is how it looks like!

And this is how the "Suprise Me" feature looks like!
